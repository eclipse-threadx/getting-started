In ADC ISR, the conversion completed flag would be cleared by reading the conversion result value. Also, the conversion result value is stored, and the ISR counter is increased. These information would be printed when the execution return to the main loop.The point is that the adc interrupt configuration is set when configuring the adc's conversion channel. When in software trigger mode, the conversion would be launched by the operation of configuring channel, just like writing aconversion command.

The direction of this change, increment or decrement, is calculated from the PHASEA and PHASEB inputs.HOME: This input can be used to trigger the initialization of the position counters. Often this signal is connected to a sensor signalling the motor or machine, sending notification that it has reached a defined home position.TRIGGER: This input can be used to clear the position counters or to take a snapshot of the POS, REV, and POSD registers.

The purpose of this demo is to show how to switch between different power modes, and how to configure a wakeup source and wakeup the MCU from low power modes. Tips: This demo is to show how the various power mode can switch to each other. However, in actual low power use case, to save energy and reduce the consumption even more, many things can be done including: - Disable the clock for unnecessary module during low power mode. That means, programmer can disable the clocks before entering the low power mode and re-enable them after exiting the low power mode when necessary. - Disable the function for unnecessary part of a module when other part would keep working in low power mode. At the most time, more powerful function means more power consumption. For example, disable the digital function for the unnecessary pin mux, and so on. - Set the proper pin state (direction and logic level) according to the actual application hardware. Otherwise, the pin cirrent would be activied unexpectedly waste some energy. - Other low power consideration based on the actual application hardware. - Debug pins(e.g SWD_DIO) would consume addtional power, had better to disable related pins or disconnect them.
