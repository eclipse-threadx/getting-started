# Getting Started with Eclipse ThreadX and Azure IoT

![](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/getting-started/workflows/Markdown%20links/badge.svg)

The Getting Started guides will help you get started with Eclipse ThreadX. Each guide will step through from toolchain installation to connecting the device to Azure IoT using IoT Plug and Play.

For more information on Azure IoT Device Development:
* [Azure IoT Device Development Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-develop) - Get started with Azure IoT device development
* For product issues, bugs, or feature requests please use our GitHub issues pages for the dedicated middleware (e.g. for ThreadX: https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/threadx/issues).
